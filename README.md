llist - linked lists for CPython
================================

llist is an extension module for CPython providing basic linked list
data structures.
Collections implemented in the llist module perform well in problems
which rely on fast insertions and/or deletions of elements in
the middle of a sequence.
For this kind of workload, they can be significantly faster than
collections.deque or standard Python lists.

This extension requires CPython 2.5 or newer (3.x is supported).
If you are looking for an implementation of linked lists in pure Python,
visit http://github.com/rgsoda/pypy-llist/
The pypy-llist module has the same API as this extension, but is
significantly slower in CPython.

Currently llist provides the following types of linked lists:
 - dllist - a doubly linked list
 - sllist - a singly linked list

Full documentation of these classes is available at:
http://packages.python.org/llist/

To install this package, either run "pip install llist",
or download it manually from http://pypi.python.org/pypi
then unpack the sources and compile them with "python setup.py install".
